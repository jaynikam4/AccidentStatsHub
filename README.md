# AccidentStatsHub
# Overview
This GitHub repository contains the Tableau project for analyzing road accidents.
The project aims to provide valuable insights into road safety and accident trends based on available data. 
Through interactive visualizations and data exploration, we hope to raise awareness about road safety and contribute to accident prevention efforts.

# Tableau Dashboards
The Tableau dashboards in this project present a comprehensive analysis of road accidents, including:

Accident Trends: Visualizes the historical trend of road accidents over time, allowing us to identify patterns and seasonal variations.
Geospatial Distribution: Maps accidents' geospatial distribution to understand accident-prone areas.
Severity Analysis: Explores the severity of accidents and factors influencing the outcome.
Contributing Factors: Analyzes various contributing factors, such as weather conditions, road type, and time of day, to gain insights into their impact on accidents.
Vehicle Involved: Visualizes the types of vehicles most commonly involved in accidents.
